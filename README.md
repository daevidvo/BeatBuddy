# **Cheerio**

## Description

* Cheerio is a web application that allows users to feel both motivated and inspired through inspirational quotes and visuals. Our web application best captivates users who are looking for words that will represent how they are feeling at that current moment. Cheerio allows users to input how they are currently feeling whether that be calm, optimistic, relaxed, etc and formulates randomized quotes and backgrounds that better captures and materializes into words what a user might be feeling at that time.

## Code Learning Points

* Using third-party CSS frameworks allowed us to really get started on our MVP. Through utilizing Cirrus as our CSS framework and parsing through the documentation, we were able to create dynamic and stylish elements in our HTML without the need for external or custom CSS. This was a choice made by our team because we liked the built-in look that came with Cirrus. 

```html 
        <div class="header-nav" id="header-menu"> <!--navbar on desktop-->
            <div class="nav-right">
                <div class="nav-item text-center">
                    <a href="https://github.com/daevidvo/Cheerio"> <!--github repo link-->
                        <span class="icon">
                            <i class="fab fa-wrapper fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> <!--github icon from font awesome-->
                        </span>
                    </a>
                </div>

                <div class="nav-item has-sub toggle-hover" id="dropdown"> <!--dropdown menu for navbar-->
                    <a class="nav-dropdown-link">More Links</a>
                    <ul class="dropdown-menu dropdown-animated" role="menu"> <!--navbar animation from cirrus-->
                        <li role="menu-item"><a href="./aboutus.html">About Us</a></li>
                        <li role="menu-item"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&pp=ygUJcmljayByb2xs">Surprise :)</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
```
 
* A vital part to the functionality of Cheerio is the usage of server-side API calls and utilizing third-party information to help in the creation of our application. Below, you can see an example of a function that executes an API call. Through utilizing the variablemood variable, we were able to get a random picture based on the user's mood and change the wallpaper of the site accordingly.

```JavaScript
//Unsplash API Call
function getUnsplash(variablemood){
  let clientID = "5EBER4yF6LOq05pKyvvFhc3yQkLyidB-RSL4FRW0a3c";
  let endpoint = "https://api.unsplash.com/photos/random/?query=" + variablemood + "&client_id=" + clientID;

  let imageEl = document.querySelector("#splash-img");
//fetch function
  fetch(endpoint)
    .then(function (response) {
      return response.json();
    })
    .then(function(jsonData) {
      imageEl.setAttribute('style', `background-image: url(${jsonData.urls.regular})`)
    })
}
```
