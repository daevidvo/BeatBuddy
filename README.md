## Description

* Cheerio is a web application that allows users to feel both motivated and inspired through inspirational quotes and visuals. Our web application best captivates users who are looking for words that will represent how they are feeling at that current moment. Cheerio allows users to input how they are currently feeling whether that be calm, optimistic, relaxed, etc and formulates randomized quotes and backgrounds that better captures and materializes into words what a user might be feeling at that time.
